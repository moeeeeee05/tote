  <p style="height: 150px;"><b>I just wanted to take a moment to remind you of something that's always true you are the most beautiful girl in the world
    , both inside and out. <br>Your smile lights up my world, your laughter is music to my ears, and your presence fills my heart with indescribable joy.<br>
    Every day, I find new reasons to fall deeper in love with you. Your kindness, your strength,
    and your unwavering support mean everything to me.<br> I feel like the luckiest person alive to have you by my side.<br>
    I want you to know that my love for you knows no bounds. It stretches beyond time and space,
     reaching into every corner of my being. You are my everything, my love, my life, and I cherish every moment we share together.<br>
    I love you more than words can express, more than the stars in the sky, more than anything in this world. Thank you for being you,
     for being mine and for filling my life with endless love and happiness.
    Forever and always.</b></p>
